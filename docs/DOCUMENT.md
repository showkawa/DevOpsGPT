# Quick Start

1. Clone the latest code or select a released version.
2. Generate the configuration file: Copy `env.yaml.tpl` and rename it to `env.yaml`.
3. Modify the configuration file: Edit `env.yaml` and add the necessary information such as GPT Token .
4. Run the service: Execute `sh run.sh` on Linux or Mac, or double-click `run.bat` on Windows.
5. Access the service: Access the service through a browser (check the startup log for the access address, default is http://127.0.0.1:8080).
6. Complete requirement development: Follow the instructions on the page to complete requirement development, and view the generated code in the `./workspace` directory.

# Configuration Details

### Basic Configuration

1. FRONTEND_PORT, BACKEND_PORT: Frontend and backend ports.
2. AICODER_ALLOWED_ORIGIN: Allowed cross-origin addresses for the backend, matching the frontend's access address. Note: If you're not accessing the website via 127.0.0.1, manually modify `apiUrl` in frontend/static/js/coder.js.
3. LANGUAGE: Language.
4. LLM_MODEL: Model.
5. GPT_KEYS: Keys for GPT, configure OpenAI and Azure API information (replace sk-xxxx with your key). If you don't need a certain type of API, delete the corresponding element entirely (openai/azure). Note: Do not add a comma after the last element in the array. You might need to use a global proxy to access the API.
6. USERS: Login user configuration.

### Git Configuration

DevOpsGPT supports integration with Git. When enabled, development tasks can pull and push code from Git.

1. GIT_ENABLED: Enable Git.
2. GIT_URL: Configure your Git address, e.g., https://github.com, https://gitlab.com.
3. GIT_TOKEN: Configure your Git token, obtainable from here: https://github.com/settings/tokens, https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens.
4. GIT_USERNAME: Git login username.
5. GIT_EMAIL: Git email.
6. APPS.service.git_path: Git path corresponding to the application, including the group, e.g., kuafuai/template_freestyleApp.

### CI Tool Configuration

DevOpsGPT supports integration with CI tools like GitlabCI, GithubActions, etc., triggering your pipeline upon code submission.

1. Complete the "Git Configuration" section above.
2. GIT_API: Configure the Git API address, e.g., https://api.github.com.
3. If using Gitlab, set up the pipeline, e.g., [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://github.com/kuafuai/template_javaWebApp_backend/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml). Also, configure Gitlab runner in Gitlab, details in the [Gitlab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).
4. If using Github, set up the pipeline, e.g., [default.yaml](https://github.com/kuafuai/template_javaWebApp_backend/blob/master/.github/workflows/default.yaml). Refer to the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions) for details.

### CD Tool Configuration

Automated deployment implementations Deploy developed applications to a cloud service in one click for all to access and use, truly moving from natural language requirements to working software!

The following uses Alibaba Cloud as an example to describe the configuration, similar to other cloud platforms, note: the use of cloud platform resources may incur a small fee.

1. Create an AccessKey on the cloud platform: Move the mouse to the avatar - Select AccessKey Management - Create an AccessKey
2. From the Kay created above, configure CD_ACCESS_KEY and CD_SECRET_KEY
3. CD_REGION: Set the deployment area, such as deployment to Hong Kong, can be configured as: cn-hongkong, please consult the cloud platform customer service
4. CD_EIP: Create a public IP address on the cloud platform for accessing the public network (the region must match CD_REGION).
5. CD_SECURITY: Create a security group on the cloud platform to enable external ports when services are started
6. CD_SWITCHï¼šCreate a switch on the cloud platform

### APPS Configuration

APPS contains information about the applications you need to develop. The first step in using the product is selecting a development application. During development, this information guides how the application should be designed and developed. In the open-source version, this information needs to be maintained manually. We'll provide AI intelligent analysis to automatically generate relevant information in the commercial version.

- app: Application, including multiple services like backend, frontend, microservices.
- name, intro: Display purposes only.
- service.name: Service name, must be unique.
- service.git_workflow: Github workflow name, effective only when Github CI is enabled.
- service.git_path: Git path, should include group, e.g., kuafuai/template_freestyleApp.
- service.base_prompt: Basic starting prompt, affects task development effectiveness.
- service.intro: Basic information about the service.
  - setpReqChooseLib (analysis of libraries/packages used together with service information).
- service.api_doc_url: API documentation URL, used to dynamically retrieve API documentation.
- service.api_doc: Current API documentation.
- service.struct: File directory structure information for the service.
  - setp1Task (used for breaking down tasks).
- service.lib: Libraries/packages available for the service.
  - setpReqChooseLib (analysis of libraries/packages used together).
- service.specification: Specification for using library packages.
